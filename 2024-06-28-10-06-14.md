Meeting with Marcus. Doing Lectio on second Corinthians chapter 8. It seems that the lesson was mostly about generosity and eagerness. In the end, what he felt was confirmation. I pressed a little bit on Weather. He was called to do something or change and he said that it confirmed what heâ€™s been saying to father Peter about legacies and the importance of generous contributions. Stewardship in a bigger picture.

For myself, I heard Paul saying that we can only give out of what we are not out of what we are not. It made me think that the fullness of Who I Am is only really found in me. and that becomes an answer to what can one person do.
