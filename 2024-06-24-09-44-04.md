Trying to get Logitech keyboard to connect to new devices.
- unable to disconnect from old devices?
- Just had a chat with Logitech and they outlined the following (I'm sure this information is linked but here it is directly):

Turn off and on the keyboard
Press the following key combinations - Esc+O (release) Esc+O (release) Esc+B
All Easy Switch light will blink continuously
Turn off and on the keyboard
Easy Switch 1 will blink continuously indicating it is ready for pairing

- above didn't seem to work
