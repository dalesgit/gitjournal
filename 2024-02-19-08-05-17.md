I’m thinking maybe I could write about what binds us as a people, Writing In a systematic faux Scholastic style that is. Here are Yeahs and nays. what I see is...

Buying Mary Pat Dulcolax. The prospect of accompanying Karol to Costco, because Mary Pat’s not up to it.

Finished reading *all the light you cannot see*. Saved the notes into Logseq.

Played a few pieces on piano. Very rusty. Tried stricter tempo, with metronome. Learn separate hands. Basic stuff. It was satisfying.

Perhaps I can just admit that she doesn’t listen to me a lot of times.

During my nap I ended up dreaming about when I was still teaching at Winthrop -- towards the end. [Perhaps because Linda referenced me being at heart a teacher] Also thinking, perhaps, of my exchanges with Peter --ref. the book on Suffering, and anticipating seeing him next month. 

But feeling the way in which I was **really alive** in my teaching.

Walking.
