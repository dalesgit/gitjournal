Waking up too early. The computer issues of yesterday swirling inside.

Julian’s  birthday today.

Spent the morning installing pieces of a working system on Toshiba. Theoretically it works. But it’s really way too slow and cumbersome.

I still remember so vividly the delivery room in which you were born. Apgar scores. Oh a fright.  The beauty of your freshly washed newborn skin.  Holding you bundled tightly. It was a day.
