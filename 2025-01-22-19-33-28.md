> I remember Roethke's words, "in the dark the eye begins to see". I know about gestation, mycelium, hearts beating in the darkness of our chest cavities. Yet in January, maybe particularly this January, I feel the dark I find myself wanting to light a warming fire within the refuge of Silence, to do everything I can to place myself in the glow of it, even to root myself here as the dark lingers through what may be a long, long winter. I sense that I am not alone in this yearning, and so in this Letter I offer tinder and kindling to keep your soulfire alight. ~ Lindsay
