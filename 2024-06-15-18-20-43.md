There were times when I was worried the connections wouldn’t work for Lydia. 

- The hike would take long and delay the day. 
- there wouldn’t be a bike for her
- we wouldn’t make the connection for her flight. It got closer and closer. We circled. There were boarding and we were still in the air.  But she made it. Last one. Got an exit seat. 

Thanks be to God.
