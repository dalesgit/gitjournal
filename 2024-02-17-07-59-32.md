# Writing.

In the quiet of the morning when I’m alone. It is my best time. Looking, longing waiting. It is my assignment, my charge my challenge. The intersection of my heart’s longing, and the great need of the world.

Yesterday I was so distraught as we had to get out the door, and I had lost a page of notes to the often times mysterious work of git. though I didn’t want to be at the Ingram’s when I was able to contribute with new insight to the conversation about hosting, Mark‘s gospel, I felt energized.

Marva most of all meant Sabbath to me.
