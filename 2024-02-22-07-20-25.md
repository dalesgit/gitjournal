Waking from a dream where Mary Pat and I had traveled by some fancy limousine sort of place to go to the Super Bowl. I ended up going to the bathroom and sort of very public toilet sort of place in the limousine and got separated from Mary Pat and the others. We found our way into the Theatre sort of place but I was still looking for familiar faces. One thing at another and someone spotted our crowd and there was Mary Pat. I asked her if this was where I was supposed to be and she said “almost surely“. And then we were in conversation with someone she had met, a large woman sort of like Joyce at church, who was very involved in theater, and so we were making plans. I guess to be in a play later in the spring.

Watched *The Secret; Dare to Dream*. Impressed by performance of Katie Holmes. Genuine. Good mom.
