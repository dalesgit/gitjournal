2 insights in the shower. At drive to church I can only remember one. In my questions with students who had converted to Islam that one of the attractions to Islam is that they take their Faith seriously. 

The same thing seems to apply to those attracted to conservative fundamentalism. They take Faith seriously.

I remember the other one. Had to do with my hesitance with the whole hearted devotion to Keating and centering prayer. Cf my resistance to cults from college to people of praise. I have already thought that my interests go in too many directions. 

Also my interest via positiva alongside via negativa.
