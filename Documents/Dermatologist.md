Meeting with Victoria for six month check out, she found two spots that she dealt with. One on my nose, and the other mole that she has been watching for a year on my back. It wasnâ€™t clear whether the mole had changed with a darker spot; so she recommended biopsy. They have a new treatment which looks at cellular level skin, and can discern whether to go ahead with a biopsy. That seemed an added expense to me.

She saw general improvement on my scalp and in my ears. Continue using the various treatments.

For the incision keep it bandaged until tomorrow morning. Use Vaseline if needed.

She also sprayed three or four spots on my arms, which showed lots of red splotches.
