# Seder meal

- Now, many Jews place an **orange** on their Seder plate as a way to show they are thinking of and including marginalized communities in Judaism, from LGBT individuals to undocumented immigrants.

Berlin-based Rabbi Avigayil Halpern tells CNN that she has seen some communities plan to add an **olive** to their Seder plate this year to show solidarity with Palestinians and call for peace. She also knows groups who add a **tomato** to represent farmworkersâ€™ rights and **sunflower seeds** representing those fleeing the war in Ukraine. She notes, though, that sunflower seeds are kitnyiot, a word that refers to products other than grains that some people eschew during Passover.
