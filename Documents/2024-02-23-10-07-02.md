Marcus and I shared the gospel in our reading. Prior to that I had voiced my passion about being disappointed at the lack of hospitality on the part of Christians who should know better.

I wanted to avoid the word suffering in the first reading, because it plays such an important role in at least the second half of my sermon , so I chose the phrase become my follower.

The second reading took me back to when in my 20s I had chosen Christianity to be my path as far as I could take it in seeking transcendence. The question then what to do about it? I have lived a life that speaks for itself, and cannot be changed.
