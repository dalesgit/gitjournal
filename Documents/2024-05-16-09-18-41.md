# Annual physical with Dr. Irvin

BP 148 / 86 
This is as high as I can remember getting, though the doctor didn't comment on it.

At the last minute he said that I was due for a pneumococcal vaccine booster. (5 years)

The result was:

1. (Fri) The next day I didn't feel well. Upset stomach and food didn't taste good.
2. (Sat) The fatigue from Fri continued through Sat. This day, after a shower, I noticed that my arm had a large red are around the injection site. That felt like confirmation that what I had been feeling was a reaction and not, e.g., COVID.
3. (Sun) Kathy H. confirmed the diagnosis of reaction, advised Advil (ibuprofen) to reduce the inflammation. I have taken several Ibuprofen's during this episode.
4. (Mon) The redness is still noticeable, almost as large, but not as bright. The arm is also still sensitive at the injection site.
