# Bread

*2 cups wheat 1 cup regular. Ball of dough almost dry. Just smidgen of dough left on finger.*

2:53 Start
6:44 1/2 tsp water
9:13 rise 1
29:15 knead 2
40:00 a double beep. For seeds?
46:30 rise 2
1:06:00 light knead
1:30:00 by this time rise 3 (but probably much earlier. 1:20 left on time.)
1:35:00 approaching the top of pan at peak.
2:00:00 dough smushed against the top. Try all wheat flour next. Maybe it was just the liquid temperature that skewed things.
