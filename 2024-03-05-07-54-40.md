# From Rohr's daily message
...

After almost fifty years of being a Franciscan Sister, I learned thatÂ beautyÂ for Franciscan theologians and philosophers is the ultimate and most intimate knowing of God, another name for God,Â theÂ name for God. Saint Bonaventure and Blessed John Duns Scotus teach that the beauty and diversity of creation nourish us through suffering and loss. When weâ€™ve run out of purpose, when memories of war sicken us, when Earth is attacked with unparalleled savagery for coal, gas, oil, timber, and profit, when poverty runs rampant and extreme wealth for very few soars, when friends betray us, and everyone we love lives far away â€¦ then, stillÂ beautyÂ endures, and helps us make it through. Like Godâ€¦. [2]

I sense now that soul knows itself and its life within the great compassionate Mystery we strive to name. Soul stirs, rises, grows toward and within the unnameable silence and beauty of God, a mothering watery God, a rain beyond Catholic, beyond any specific religion or creed, a rain that soothes us in suffering and challenges complacency. Soul flowers in this rain of the worlds, of meteor showers, of the cosmos. [3]
