I was really grumpy on waking and throughout the morning. I admitted to Mary Pat that this week was not going to be vacation for me. I didn't say that I had dreaded out for several weeks. She asked if it was the company? I said no but it was a part of it. And it is all driven by Mary Pat's stuff and friends. She adjectives if it was about my sermon (Easter)? I said no. 

The best part of the day was connecting to MO on her birthday. Not really because of her. The relationship is mutual caring but very distant. It's just that it was my stuff. 

Notified Marcus. Did wordle. Learned now to manipulate a git repository on the phone. 

Dinner with Amy and patch. They are almost my stuff. Amy is still ambivalent about learning about her mother. 

Lectio discussion took us in the general arena of doubt. Both of us magical disbelieve in the faith of our youth. For me:

- all god talk is metaphorical
- the immensity of God the creator together with a God who suffered, isn't all knowing, and could mourn over all kinds of stuff. 
- whether I believe this or that,  I said, doesn't really matter. I meant in the way of protestant "solas". I think mostly it doesn't matter to God. She wondered what about my congregations? Sermon audience?
