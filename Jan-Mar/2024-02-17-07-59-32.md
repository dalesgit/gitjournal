# Writing.

In the quiet of the morning when I’m alone. It is my best time. Looking, longing waiting. It is my assignment, my charge my challenge. The intersection of my heart’s longing, and the great need of the world.

Yesterday I was so distraught as we had to get out the door, and I had lost a page of notes to the often times mysterious work of git. though I didn’t want to be at the Ingram’s when I was able to contribute with new insight to the conversation about hosting, Mark‘s gospel, I felt energized.

Marva most of all meant Sabbath to me.

Accomplished. 

1. Draft of sermon
2. Read in Pharisees
3. Prayed 
4. Prepped Sunday texts
5. I announced that I was going into the bedroom to write for an hour or so. It was accepted and was productive.

Reading intently in *All the light …* See highlights. 

Lynn Hart talked with MP for 30 minutes. Close to normal, about teaching, retirement, relating my enchantment with the faculty critiques we got at St. Joseph’s College. 

Post mortem now.

All day a slow and steady rain.

The frustration of asking MP whether she wants to eat in front of the tv. She responds with I don’t care so it’s my decision. But I have spent my life not wanting dinner and tv combined. But with MP I’ve allowed it. Is it my failure to assert myself. Do I really not care?  It’s an example of how I’ve lost myself in my effort to find peace and love.

Could I play Chopin prelude in E min?
