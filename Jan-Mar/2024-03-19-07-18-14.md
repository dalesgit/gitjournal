Another dream featuring bicycles. It seemed like Colorado Springs. Earlier I had tried to get chronology straight, based on when Margot rebuffed my efforts to seduce her. 

- when did I go to Europe with her
- JP
- when sleeping with Lynn and Marilyn
- when the White House with drugs and JP and my brother and police at the door
- MO sculpting me at her house, shared with girls including Margot. I was sitting in the nude. Margot and others came in the door to see. 

The dream I was riding my bike home. On the way I stopped at a house with people and children I knew. I had been at a scene of an event or something similar to other dreams. I was supposed to be in a performance where I had a small part, like the plays in Honolulu. 

While in the house, someone stole my bike. I was determined to recover it. I outfoxed them in a manner like the Amy Adams character in “Leap Year”  we saw with the Judges. She burst into the room with the thieves. Told them off. That started a brawl with the Irish character, destined to be her spouse.

Peter immediately criticized Larry Hooper for using his wife in the sermon. And at that it was ambiguous what he was getting at with the illustration. Or with the sermon. Communication? Responding to all the broken hearts around us? Larry’s effort to see Christ in all persons?
