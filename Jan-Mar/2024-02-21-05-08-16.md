Waking up too early. The computer issues of yesterday swirling inside.

Julian’s  birthday today.

Spent the morning installing pieces of a working system on Toshiba. Theoretically it works. But it’s really way too slow and cumbersome.

I still remember so vividly the delivery room in which you were born. Apgar scores. Oh a fright.  The beauty of your freshly washed newborn skin.  Holding you bundled tightly. It was a day. It was a day. Does your Buddy know that it’s your special day? I hope so. Are you off skiing? I hope so. I pray that you have a most exuberant day, engaged in exactly what you would wish to be doing. I simply don’t have a clue what sort of thing I might buy for you for a gift. I’ll send off today a check, but it sent with lots and lots of feeling fatherly affection for you. Shalom. Aloha. Love. Dad.

#names. Mike and ? He is Asian, Japanese. Helped at church lunch. Ann and Richard Clark? Couple on the end, he in a wheel chair like Diane. She seeming enormously reserved inside a protective cloak.

Watched *Alice doesn’t live here anymore*. Ellen got academy award. Kris Kristopherson. Directed by Martin Scorsese.
