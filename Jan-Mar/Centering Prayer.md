# Centering Prayer March 9, 2024

- Elaine here but not Lou 
- contemplative prayer. Not what we do or say or earn 
- centering is a method preparing us to contemplative. 
- ca 25?
- 11:11 [quick capture](https://www.avonctlibrary.info/books-media/)
- Free library
- Evelyn Underhill pdf https://www.catholicspiritualdirection.org/cloudunknowing.pdf
- centering about consent to Gods activities and presence in our inner life
- word is sacred symbol— “that effects what it signifies”
- it is a method not a technique 
- nb I haven’t tried to verbalize or reflect on the history of my seeking contemplative/ mystical experiences.
