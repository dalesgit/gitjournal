Dermatologist

- She described three levels of mole type growths, lesions. The first star benign, and the third are malignant. Then there is a middle classification that itself has three levels. My biopsy came back in the middle level. The recommendation for that middle level is a choice of monitoring or removing the rest of the lesion. I chose the latter as being simpler.
- she refreeze the lesion on my nose.
- she is only working three more weeks, but then will be back from her maternity leave in August.
- she recommends Vaseline every day until the scab is gone for healing.
