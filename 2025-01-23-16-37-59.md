## re. Thin Places

When I was processing my upcoming move from Hawai'i to the mainland, I talked a number of times with my Spiritual Director about what to expect and how to continue my spiritual direction. He told me that I should look where there is a concentration of Native Americans. He said that in his experience, indigenous people have an ability to know where there are **thin places**, places where the distance between the sacred and the profane is especially porous, "thin".

## a recent *Substack* post 

Over the next few months on the Liturgical Rebels podcast I will interview a variety of people from different cultures, ethnicities and orientations who hold diverse ideas of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. Today’s interview is with Rev. Dr Randy Woodley a Cherokee descendent, who calls himself a follower of Jesus but not a Christian. His indigenous Native American perspective is an inspiration and a breath of fresh air in the midst of what seem to be increasingly distorted views of what it means to be a Christian.

In this episode of the Liturgical Rebels podcast, Randy Woodley shares his diverse life journey, rooted in his Native American heritage and shaped by his experiences in Western Christianity. He discusses the challenges and insights gained from his faith journey, emphasizing the importance of Indigenous values and the concept of Eloheh, which represents living in harmony. Woodley also reflects on his book, 'Shalom and the Community of Creation,' exploring the values that promote a harmonious existence within communities and the natural world.

In this conversation, I delve into the profound themes of harmony, Shalom, and Indigenous values with Randy Woodley . We explore the interconnectedness of creation and the importance of living in harmony with the environment and each other. Randy also shares ecological and spiritual insights from his children's book 'The Harmony Tree' which is a favourite of both of ours. The discussion also touches on his collaborative work with his wife Edith at the [Eloheh Indigenous Center for Earth Justice](https://substack.com/redirect/f5f1d3b9-59ff-4370-a266-7e0244592416?j=eyJ1IjoiMW91ejZvIn0.xCUUX-G1mqOe_p0uPEybRD6sQoY3OtX97OlEZbEJxWg), emphasizing the need for regenerative practices and the teaching of Indigenous spirituality. We conclude with a reflection on indigenous values that can lead to a more stable and happy society.

## from R. Rohr's blog "Creating the Future by Honoring the Past"

*Cherokee descendent Rev. Dr. Randy Woodley and his wife Edith Woodley of the Eastern Shoshone tribe highlight how honoring the wisdom and traditions of our ancestors can inspire us to become healers and changemakers, creating a path to a better future:* 

When we pass our traditions down to the next generation, we are passing down the presence of all our ancestors who came before us. Those songs and stories and teachings are not just from us but from those who came before us. Our ceremonies connect us to our ancestors because we know they once stood where we now stand, using the same traditions.  

I (Edith) bead Indian jewelry. My mother also did great Indian beadwork. Often when I am beading, I find my thoughts drifting to my mother, especially when I look at my hands. I think about what she would do with a color or a stitch, or how she looked for patterns or asked my dad what he thought. Then I ask Randy the same questions. In some ways, my mother is there with me during that practice. Randy’s mom loved nature, especially birds and flowers. When he sees exceptionally beautiful birds or flowers, his mother always comes to mind. “My mom would love this one,” he often says to me when he sees a hummingbird or a robin or a pretty flower. Our ancestors are always present to lead us into the future.  

When sharing stories, Native American elders often drift freely between current and past events. They may begin a story by saying something like “A long time ago …,” but if you listen carefully, you’ll notice that the behavior or problem they are addressing is likely a current one. Indigenous learning comes through reflected experience. We learn about how to live now by examining what has happened in our history.  

We depend on our stories, our ceremonies, and other traditions to guide us to a good future. Often that future is best expressed through exploring things from the past. We mine our past for those gems that are our payment for the future. That is why our stories and other past concerns are so very important. Without our past, we cannot be a people in the future.  

Think about what you have carried forward from your parents, grandparents, or caregivers. What practices, ideas, or lifeways rooted in the past are you keeping alive? 

## from *Earth Prayer*

> *I have read from this book for several years as a part of my evening prayers. It is filled with sources that might well be characterized as **indigenous**. Below is an example.*

Grandfather Great Spirit\
All over the world the faces of living ones\
are alike.\
With tenderness they have come up out\
of the ground\
Look upon your children that they may face the winds and walk the good road to\
the Day of Quiet.\
Grandfather Great Spirit\
Fill us with the Light.\
Give us the strength to understand, and the eyes to see.\
Teach us to walk the soft Earth as relatives\
to all that live.

-- SIOUX PRAYER
