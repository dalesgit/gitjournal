# Lydia

Lydia

Countless are the days that I wake up having come round and round with thoughts of Lydia. How could I break through whatever it is that prevents communication? What have I done to cause it? How could I show her that I am receptive any time she was ready to reach out?

Convey the sadness?

MP and I had talk about prayer and about my unhappiness here inn FL and my need for boundaries. I said my two great needs for being alive are: writing and thinking

While walking Lydia responded to me. It takes so little for me to hope for a connection with her. At least I got to express my love for her. She had been under stress she said.
