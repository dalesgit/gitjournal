Dreams:

1. I was encouraged to be a part of some bishop's work. The location seemed to be Hawai'i but it was someone who trusted me.
2. There was a lost statue of some kind -- result of an air crash / accident. I was out on my bike, looking and curious. I was supposed to be at home. There were figures around me that reminded of Filipinos and other locals I knew in Hawai'i.
