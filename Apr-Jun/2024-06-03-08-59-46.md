**Sufi tale**: where do we seek? Wise man lost something. Where did you lose it? In the house. Why are we searching outside? There's more light.

"They will seek my face ... their misery will drive them to seek ... ". Hosea 5

Help me to be sensitive to and recognize the irritants that are the indicator that I am seeking you in some way.
