Brian is gone. About 4:30. It is as if Mary Pat were there. What a privilege to have traveled this road with her.

Cynthia Marie: 

A Commendatory Prayer

Into your hands, O merciful Savior, we commend your servant Brian.  Acknowledge, we humbly beseech you, a sheep of your own fold, a lamb of your own flock, a sinner of your own redeeming. Receive him into the arms of your mercy, into the blessed rest of everlasting peace, and into the glorious company of the saints in light. Amen.

May his soul and the souls of all the departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen
