From America magazine:

> Jesus proposes to his disciples that they treat children and slaves as his own emissaries, indeed as ambassadors of God. This is his response to the disciples arguing about who was the greatest among them. If you want to heap honors on someone, find a child; if you want to hear words that carry weight, listen to a slave. If you want to encounter the divine, seek out a person of no account and recognize that youâ€™re standing in the presence of Christ himself.
