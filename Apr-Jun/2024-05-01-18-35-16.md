Talk to Lydia. She’s had a cold for two weeks and is feeling discouraged and lonely. We talked about it a little, which was really good. She’s had some job interviews, moving into the south Bend district proper where she’s being treated more professionally. There will be a job interview tomorrow and she will text me about how it went .

she asked about activities in Granby and she will be in touch with Owen to get an idea about that. She would like to have a bubble bath. Fishing came up as a possibility that would be intriguing to her. She has only caught one fish in her life out of a pond.

Pass on to her YouTube of Dalai Lama and Tutu on joy.
