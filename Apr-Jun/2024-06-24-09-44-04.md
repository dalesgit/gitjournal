Trying to get Logitech keyboard to connect to new devices.
- unable to disconnect from old devices?
- Just had a chat with Logitech and they outlined the following (I'm sure this information is linked but here it is directly):

Turn off and on the keyboard
Press the following key combinations - Esc+O (release) Esc+O (release) Esc+B
All Easy Switch light will blink continuously
Turn off and on the keyboard
Easy Switch 1 will blink continuously indicating it is ready for pairing

- above didn't seem to work
- It certainly appears that Amazon has cut off broad compatibility with Android. 
- Specialized keyboard for fire 10, 8 etc. but also "wide compatibility" $15.99
- Another keyboard for fire 7 (12) which is what I have $24.95
