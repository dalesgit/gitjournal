For Al Kunkel

Al, Thank you for the information about *On the Road with St. Augustine*. It looks like it is a book I want to read -- soon. I think the edition that I would recommend for reading the *Confessions* is the one by Sara Ruden.  Augustine. _Confessions_. Translated by Sarah Ruden. First edition. Modern Library edition. New York: The Modern Library, 2017. Here are links to 2 sites that give a good overview of where to go next with reading Augustine. This link is an interview <https://fivebooks.com/best-books/augustine-catherine-conybeare/>. In it the author includes the Peter Brown biography which is one of the titles I was trying to think of when we were talking. The 2nd link is <https://medium.com/@ebruenig/a-short-augustine-reading-list-d009406021c0>. It is an intriguing and offbeat take on the "essentials". Both of these together are a suitable introductin to Augustine.
