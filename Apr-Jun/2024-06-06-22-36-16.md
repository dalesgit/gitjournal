A day with Bill and Karla. Visiting the lodge dating way back in Karlaâ€˜s childhood. But also a shared experience with them as a couple.

They passed on to Mary Pat especially the spelling game from New York Times. They talk about it and have their own rules that turn it from it , individual competition to we at the end.
