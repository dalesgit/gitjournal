Dreams:

1. I was encouraged to be a part of some bishop's work. The location seemed to be Hawai'i but it was someone who trusted me.
2. There was a lost statue of some kind -- result of an air crash / accident. I was out on my bike, looking and curious. I was supposed to be at home. There were figures around me that reminded of Filipinos and other locals I knew in Hawai'i.

# Bridget

It's so difficult for me to image Bridget's face -- to say nothing of trying to imagine (trying) to be intimate with her.

It dawned on me during our trip that Bridget has alienated everyone who gets near her.

1. 2 priests
2. 2 husbands
3. son
4. Emma (apparently)
5. Lydia (subtly)
