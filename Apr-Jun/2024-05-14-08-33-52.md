perfecting holiness (1 Co 7:1) lost images of holy people. Schweitzer, Mother Teresa, L'Arche,

In the last couple days I have thought that from youth to mid-life I've sought answers to "what should I do."  Now I am more focused on "how to be."

Nevertheless I admire and desire the retirees like Larry who learn something well in retirement. 

As earlier, I have 

- cooked and baked
- repaired the shower
- repaired garage lights
- input music for future seder
- plan piano playing
- think theologically at centering prayer
- repaired sun visor
