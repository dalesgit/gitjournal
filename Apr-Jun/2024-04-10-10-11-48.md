Joanne at local Southstate continued the runaround and passing the buck in trying to get title to the car. 

MP called Florida title who tracked something and informed us that the title was in South Carolina (not North Carolina as we had been led to believe). 

I called the branch on Ebenezer that had always been so good to us. Got the name of the manager and his cell phone. He responded! 

Josh Nyegaard: 803-325-5950.

He recognizes that there was a screw up. He talked about the normal process would be a “lien release letter” that he will need to get from higher up the chain. He gave us his card and will contact us by Friday.
