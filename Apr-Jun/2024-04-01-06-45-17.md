Lydia was all in my heart as I was walking. That meant Bridget forced her way in too. I realize I blame Bridget for Lydia's gentle fragile personality. Her depression. I thought my super love would have been sufficient. But it was circumvented. I feel on the ways Bridget was so wrong for me. At least not good for me.
