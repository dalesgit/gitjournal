Watched *Dark Waters* with Mark Ruffalo. Going after **DuPont** for the “forever” chemicals related to Teflon. 

I think of the impact of petroleum burning and how the impact on the planet does not factor into the **cost** of it all.

Who pays?

The movie makes apparent that DuPont rules, is untouchable. Like so many others of the industrial complex. 

I feel so depressed over it all.
