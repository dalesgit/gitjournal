A poignant time talking with Lydia. She blames herself for Jacob alienation.atShe was the first to say to me that "obviously Bridget and I shouldn't have married." I told her that, while the argument works for Mary Pat and Doug, it doesn't with her mother and me, because "the fruit of the marriage was the 2 most precious things in the world to me."

Out of random insight, I said to her that among all my children, she was the one I felt the deepest rapport. Based on the years spent sharing deeply -- e.g. bedtime. 

I related how that seemed to end at the time that I helped her get into therapy and she realized that I was what she was most angry at. 

She related that I should be understanding with regard to Emma, because she felt the converse of my relationship with Lydia. that "I liked Lydia more than Emma." I related *True Confessions* or *Blues Brothers*. 

With tears she related that she had such anger and hatred toward me and Mary Pat. Looking out over *Frazier Canyon* at the top of the ski lift. 

I recalled Bridget refusing to allow my mother and George to watch them while we went to convention. Also Miriam's wedding when there were plans for them to go to Logan's first wedding. It was she who refused to go with my plans.

I told story of my last days with my mother. 

Different perspective for folks at latter part of life.
