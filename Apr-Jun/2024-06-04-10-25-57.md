Yesterday several interesting things from being with Julian:

1. He remembers seeing *Neverending Story* and being deeply afraid of the dog figure. The same dog that Peter's Milo reminds Mary Pat of.
2. He seemed to relate a scenario where Lydia, Emma, and Bridget were at Mo's house when Bridget was moving to Indiana.
3. He also "remembered" seeing a movie that he thought he saw with us. It involved a gay man married to a woman who knew about his sexuality. **We can't remember or identify such a thing**. Perhaps the movie with Colin Firth (as gay partner) whose partner dies and he is shut out of his life.

**Lectio**

Is. 59 "Because of your iniquities, you are hidden from God."

Paired with "sin" but iniquities sounds like "inequality". Isaiah as the originator of a "transcendent God". In Garden of Eden we stopped experiencing God as **with** us and began the God "out there."

Mary Pat hears me as abdicating my responsibility to approach Emma and reconciliation. I see myself as the Prodigal Father.
