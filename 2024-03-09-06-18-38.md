I’ve had so little time to myself this week, and I anticipate that continuing for several weeks. Finally this morning, I am awake and alone.

In my dreams I was biking across the west. Another earlier dream I had got myself lost on a hike, with mountains And rivers. Suddenly, I was not going to be able to get home to Mary Pat in time. I persuaded family with young people to drive me. That prove to be an adventure and for some reason I didn’t alert Mary Pat to what was going on.

One of my stops in one of the dreams, I was trying to go to church to get communion. I had a young person in my toe. It may be left over from the family. I was traveling with we ended up in Bob Fitzpatrick’s cathedral, although it wasn’t Saint Andrews. It was something like, Lakewood, junior high school and the cathedrals of Milwaukee and northern Indiana. It took a while, but I finally figured out that Bob had ordered a whole new approach to being Church. There were consultants that were driving everything. And when I got to the communion rail no one wanted to give me communion. After a while, I figured out that the problem was that the consultants had said that that was not important to the new and hip generation.

Today is the big day with the centering prayer workshop. I want to do anything I need to to facilitate Mary Pat success. Diana will be my charge.

Lectio: From Matthew's transfiguration. The voice is the prominent image and focus. Keating hears what the voice commands: "Listen to him." Poignant rhetorical shift. Cp. Rohr's shift in how to hear the word "Christ."

"Listen to him" is the urging from Linda. Pay attention. From Common Prayer today the message, "Use your gifts for others."

> Basil of Caesarea, a fourth-century bishop and monk, asked, “Are you not a robber, you who consider your own that which has been given you solely to distribute to others? This bread which you have set aside is the bread of the hungry; this garment you have locked away is the clothing of the naked; those shoes which you let rot are the shoes of him who is barefoot; those riches you have hoarded are the riches of the poor.”

> Lord, keep us from speaking of love while hoarding the gifts you have given us. Make us full of discontent as long as there are brothers and sisters living and dying in hunger. Amen.
