Last night we finished watching "Shirley" Chisholm. It seemed so grateful to watch the wise black politicians put their faith in the "electable" George McGovern. And then to know that what follows is the fateful attempted coup by Richard Nixon. Deja Vu. 

I woke up feeling so overwhelmed with the prospects of Trump becoming the dictator of Amerika. 

In that context where an I with Good Friday?

Meeting with Marcus:

He began when I shared the plague of my being scattered, and not focused on one thing, thinking of playing piano, and he put it in terms of centering prayer. It was clear to me at that point that the discipline of centering prayer has been significant for him. At the end of our time he cited that as the measure of being a less favorable lent versus an acceptable lent.

That was in the context of relating their discipline of spending time at the Gethsemane garden hour of prayer together that they began this year by centering together.

he wanted to know about my experience of Maundy Thursday and Triduum. I ended up giving him a rather fall exposition about my experience with the fullness of baptism and sacraments. My first response to him was thatâ€™s my sermon on Saturday.
