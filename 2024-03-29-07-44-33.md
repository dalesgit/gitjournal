Last night we finished watching "Shirley" Chisholm. It seemed so grateful to watch the wise black politicians put their faith in the "electable" George McGovern. And then to know that what follows is the fateful attempted coup by Richard Nixon. Deja Vu. 

I woke up feeling so overwhelmed with the prospects of Trump becoming the dictator of Amerika. 

In that context where an I with Good Friday?
