# Centering prayer

It is not a technique. Which is a practice with an expected result. Method is the practice of building a relationship. May not work. See there fruits of the spirit. 

It's not a method of relaxation. 

20 minutes twice per day. First increase 1/2 -- 3/4 of the day. Pray again early evening, refill the reservoir to influence the peace of the day.

Seeking a transformation.
