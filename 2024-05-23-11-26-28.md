Non-anxious presence as a manifestation of Keating's divine therapy (Candy).

Play with it

I was transported to an ethereal place watching the documentary on Leonard Cohen. Hallelujah. It resonates so deep. The facsimile of a page Bernstein's manuscript of Simple Song hanging in the choir room. LC thanking everyone. Trying to make sense of it all. Must be 40 yo to study Kabbalah. 150+ verses to the song.
