Awake from dream in afternoon. With a start I walked across a street. Seemed like toward 690 Dudley. I collapsed to the ground. I could see my body lying there. And I couldn’t speak though I tried and tried. I couldn’t move though I was using everything I had to try to move. I thought this is what it is like to have a stroke. I feared a car running over me as I lay there unmoving.
