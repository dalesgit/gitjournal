Be of good courage
Wait on the  Lord

God doesn't intervene immediately

Origen of Alexandria wrote, “I do not call the Law an ‘Old Testament’ if I understand it in the Spirit. The Law becomes an ‘Old Testament’ only for those who wish to understand it carnally, but for those who understand it and apply it in the Spirit and in the Gospel sense, the Law is ever new and the two Testaments are a new Testament for us, not because of their date in time but because of the newness of the meaning. For those who do not respect the covenant of love, even the Gospels are ‘old.’ ” (Common Prayer)

This is close (by some reading anyway) to what I have been trying to say about the "Old Testament". He was talking about his allegorical (spiritual) interpretation.
