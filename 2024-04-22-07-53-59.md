Contradictory vs complementary

Keating on non-duality

Computer work is duality from ground up

Hauser: a Jesuit wrote about biblical vs western spirituality. 

This morning prayer was about touch of God.  How do I feel God?

When did I first experience non-duality? When I saw candles burning in church?
