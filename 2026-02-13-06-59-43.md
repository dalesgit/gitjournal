Yesterday tried to install "jrnl" in Samsung.

I tried several times, with pip and pipx. pipx failed. but in the end I did get pip to install it. But I can't get it to actually work.

The first time I ran it it somehow automagically identified the jrnl file in zettelkasten. But it was the original file. not the diary style that I have just started. Then I couldn't get it to add anything.

- pip install maturin, cryptography, python, jrnl
- pipx install jrnl failed

The whole problem was that I had a workaround in my bashrc for reading the Zettelkasten file. Deleted that and things seem to be working normally.
