Lydia:

Direction from someone: "Do what made you happy as a child." But she said, "Basically I've neveer been happy." But I'm learning to try new things. I look at what my kids are doing. New things, I just say, 'Screw it and give it a try.' [Thus her excitement at going bike ride with Julian.]

I asked her if there was anything she knew that would help Emma (or not make things worse). She said, "Just pray for her." She's in a rocky relationship with both sides of her family. (Her mother's side also.) She said that she is in therapy trying to sort out the heavy stuff she's carried for a long time. She is planning video therapy with Bridget and Lydia. 

Lydia thought that maybe I could suggest that she do that with me. She wasn't sure, but ...

Remembering that yesterday Lydia said that she has always known that she was my favorite, and that Emma recognized the opposite about her. [I never thought of it that way. Mary Pat thought that Emma was my favorite.]

I told Lydia about the movies, "... your problem is that you always that that I was mom's favorite. Well, I was!"
