In prayer: MP experienced a synchronicity between her choosing lectio passage and Keating morning prayer. Like the waves of the ocean, sometimes there`s a rhythm.

For me in the lectio: be open to surprise. *open the eyes of my heart, Lord*.

My Lord God,
I have no idea where I am going.
I do not see the road ahead of me.
I cannot know for certain where it will end.
Nor do I really know myself,
and the fact that I think that I am following Your will does not mean that I am actually doing so.
But I believe that the desire to please You does in fact please You.
And I hope that I have that desire in all that I am doing.
And I know that if I do this, You will lead me by the right road although I may know nothing about it.
Therefore will I trust You always, though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death,
I will not fear, for You are ever with me, and will never leave me to face my perils alone.

Thomas Merton
