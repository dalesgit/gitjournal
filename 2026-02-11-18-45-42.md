Talked with Sarah for extended time:

- what is your process for writing sermons
- do you have a main point you want to accomplish
- one of my first is to never say something I think not true
- remembered introducing Maya Angelou
- recently thinking that I'm looking for some aha moments. These are signs of God's presence. God always present but we're only occasionally aware
- started building the umbrella for porch
- installed mxlinux on beeline. Learning some about the bit process. - Eg I can still boot into endeavor os
