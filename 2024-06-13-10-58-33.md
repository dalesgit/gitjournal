A poignant time talking with Lydia. She blames herself for Jacob alienation.atShe was the first to say to me that "obviously Bridget and I shouldn't have married." I told her that, while the argument works for Mary Pat and Doug, it doesn't with her mother and me, because "the fruit of the marriage was the 2 most precious things in the world to me."

Out of random insight, I said to her that among all my children, she was the one I felt the deepest rapport. Based on the years spent sharing deeply -- e.g. bedtime. 

I related how that seemed to end at the time that I helped her get into therapy and she realized that I was what she was most angry at. 

She related that I should be understanding with regard to Emma, because she felt the converse of my relationship with Lydia. that "I liked Lydia more than Emma." I related *True Confessions* or *Blues Brothers*. 

With tears she related that she had such anger and hatred toward me and Mary Pat. Looking out over *Frazier Canyon* at the top of the ski lift. ![Image](./c7b7e3da5099674ac33253607360d3e7.jpg) ![Image](./c7b7e3da5099674ac33253607360d3e7.jpg)
